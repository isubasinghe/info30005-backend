## Note to marker
While there might be some slight expressions of frustration and lack of description in some commit messages, 
this had to be done because of how we setup CI/CD on AWS. Futher on, our Beanstalk on AWS, is tied
to a PM2 dashboard for analytics/metrics. Testing integrations with PM2 dashboard required these kind of 
commits to master as well. 

Please note for every other commit, we were expressive and organised using Git.
In fact we have a KanBan board on Github itself (Zenhub Browser extension) that we use for feature tracking/Review etc.
Additionally we used seperate branches for these feature and had code reviews when merging.
